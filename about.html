          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <strong><p>Hi I am Aarush Aggarwal, a software engineering aspirant and a high school student in New Delhi India. Over the past few years I have gained a lot of skills related to programming.
            Along with that I also love to play basketball and badminton, and am a self-proclaimed audiophile and music producer. I have worked on several real-time projects, in web development(intelliger)
            robotics(a remote controlled car) and core programming(a virtual assistant). I have also done multiple courses on Python, Java, Web Development, Algorithms and Robotics with Arduino.
            I also have a true passion for understanding the working behind technological devices, from how the hull of a car is made to how bits of data are transmitted over the internet in binary.
            My favourite pass times are binge watching netflix or trying out for the various activities my school hosts.
          </p></strong></div>
